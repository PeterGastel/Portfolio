# The Ground Up Project is an assignment from Noble Desktop, in which I coded a website for a 
Coffee Shop (Ground Up) from a given Figma mock-up. 
The project includes HTML, CSS and GSAP-animations in JS. 
All the PNG & SVG were given, but I did all the coding myself.

Figma mock-up can be found in the Images folder.
